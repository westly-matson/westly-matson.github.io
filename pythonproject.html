    <tr><center>In this python quiz you will be faced with some heavy questions, get your tissues ready and a extra set of underwear set aside for when your done with the quiz. to start the quiz you have to call the funtion statrgame(), to do this you juts type 'a' and the quiz will begin. Once the quiz has started you will be faced with 4 random questions, do your best to get them right and good luck. One problem I had with coding this quiz was getting it to keep score, I thought i did everything right but i didnt, i had to get help from a friend and he set each function to global val to keep score everytime you got a question right. Another problem i had was getting the code to pick a random question, it took me adn my parter a while to get it to work but we eventually did, we had the computer pic ka random number and whatever number it pick would call a function that was a question and would do this four times and then stop the game. <center></tr>
